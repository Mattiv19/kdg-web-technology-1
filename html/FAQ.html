    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Delivery</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What's your Return Policy?</summary>
        <p>The last thing we want is for our customers to be unhappy with one of our products, but if for some reason
          you are then we are happy to exchange the item / provide store credit within 21 days or refund within 14
          days of delivery. Ensure the order is sent back in the condition it was received with the original receipt
          and a note on.</p>
        <p>Please note, all sale items are exchange or store credit, within the 21 day time policy. For exchanges we
        will cover the shipping back out to the customer after exchanged as goodwill to help accommodate the change.</p>
        <p>Any discount codes or free shipping deductions that are used and become invalid will be automatically
             deducted from the refund value. (Under €75 on EU order, under $100 on Int order). We are unable to
          refund any duties and taxes paid or incurred on an order.</p>
        <p>We cannot take responsibility for an incorrect shipping address filled on the site. Please ensure you check
            your completed address to make sure it is deliverable. </p>
        <p> Please download and print our returns form to return the products.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you ship internationally?</summary>
        <p>Of course, we ship worldwide! More details about duties and taxes for your location, please visit our

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can my order by changed or cancelled?</summary>
        <p>An order can be changed or cancelled prior to shipping, but cannot be amended after it has been shipped, please ensure you email quickly. We can also exchange items after received under the policy but do not offer free return postage unfortunately.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>When can I expect my order?</summary>
        <p>All items are sent tracked. We have worked on the very best shipping solutions for our customers and absorb some of the cost to help.</p>
        <ul>

        <summary>Can I track my order?</summary>
        <p>Yes! You will receive a direct link to your tracking in your shipping confirmation. Simply click on the link to view the up to date tracking for your order.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that it might take 24-48 hours from the moment your parcel is shipped for tracking information to be updated.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What happens when I miss the delivery of my order?</summary>
        <p>That depends on the carrier, but most of the time your order is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delivered at a nearby pick-up location</li>
          <li>Delivered at your neighbours, unless you have informed us or the carrier that you do not prefer to have
            parcels delivered at your neighbours.</li>
          <li>Delivered at a second attempt the next business day.</li>
          <li>At all times the carrier leaves you a (digital) note with the delivery details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you've opted for your order to be delivered in a store, the store will hold onto to it for 14 days once you have received the conformation that your order is ready to be collected. After 14 days the order will be returned to our warehouse and you’ll be automatically refunded within 10 to 14 days.</p>

      <h3>Payments</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What payment methods can I use?</summary>
        <p>When you shop with us online, you can use the following payment methods:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mastercard</li>
          <li>VISA</li>
          <li>Paypal</li>
          <li>iDeal</li>
          <li>American Express</li>
          <li>Bank Transfer*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Note: we will start the shipping process upon receipt of the bank transfer, resulting in a 1-2 day delay
          .</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>My order was cancelled, what happens to my payment?</summary>
        <p>If money has been taken from your account even though your order was unsuccessful or got canceled, this amount has only been reserved by your bank and will automatically bounce back to your account within 2-5 working days.</p>
        <p>If the amount was withdrawn from your account instead of bouncing back, please contact us and we will check this for you.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How can I use Paypal as a payment method?</summary>
        <p>When you select PayPal in our checkout, we’ll lead you straight to the PayPal site. If you already have an account, you can log in and confirm the payment. If you don’t have a PayPal account yet, you can set one up and easily proceed with the payment. Refunds from returns will be booked onto the registered PayPal account.</p>
        <p>To make sure everything will be delivered at the right address, please check if all the information in your PayPal account is correct.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>When will I receive a refund after I returned an item/an order?</summary>
        <p>It usually takes up to 5 working days for a return to reach our warehouse. Once it gets there the parcel
          is scanned, after which a refund is automatically triggered. It takes about 8 to 10 business days after the
          returned items are scanned for the refund to find its way back to your bank account. We’ll be using the
          same payment method you did whilst placing the order. For the latest updates on your refund, it’s easiest
          to check your bank account directly. If you paid by credit card, no amount has been deducted from your
          account, or the reserved amount will be released back to your bank account.</p>
